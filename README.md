# PP - psychophysics stimulus presentation

Psychophysical experiments to show movies, pictures and drawings (e.g. gratings, dots) with and without code to operate an SR research eye tracker. Eye tracking scripts include code to start the calibration mode at begninning of each run and create time stamps in the eye tracking data for the begninning and end of each trial. All scripts can collect button presses from any device (CurrentDesign hardware, keyboards) and save the behavioral data and the eye tracking data in designated folders.


# fMRI - fMRI stimulus presentation

fMRI experiments to show movies and pictures with code to operate an SR research eye tracker. Each script includes code to start the calibration mode at begninning of each run and create time stamps in the eye tracking data for the begninning and end of each trial. All scripts can collect button presses from any device (CurrentDesign hardware, keyboards) and save the behavioral data and the eye tracking data in designated folders. All scripts are build to wait for a trigger signal in the beginning and to optimize timing by adjusting ISIs if the onset of one or more stimuli is delayed.
